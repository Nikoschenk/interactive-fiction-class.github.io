        "In this notebook, we will introduce you word embeddings.  Word embeddings are a way of representing the meaning of words using vectors.  This style of meaning representation is different than what we saw with WordNet.  Rather than manually organizing words into a hierarchy and breaking words into their distinct senses like WordNet does, word vectors are computed automatically based on their coocurrence with other words in very large collections of texts (which are called _corpora_ in NLP).  Word vector representations do not give us hypernym, hyponym or antonym relationships by default, but they do give us an extremely straightforward way of computing the similarity of two words.  Similarity is computed by comparing the vectors and computing the angle between them with cosine.  Vectors with a very small angle between them tend to correspond to words with very similar meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting around 2013, several algorithms were developed to create efficiently word vectors.  The most famous of which is the word2vec algorithm developed by researchers at Google. \n",
        "If you'd like to learn more about how word vectors, I recommend that you read the [Vector Semantics and Embeddings](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) in the [Speech and Language Processing textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Jurafsky and Martin who are currently updating the textbook and are relasing their draft chapters for free online while they are updating the book."
