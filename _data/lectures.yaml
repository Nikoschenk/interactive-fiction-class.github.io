  title: Text Adventure Games
  description: Introduction to text adventure games. We discuss what these games are and the parsing of user input.  Text adventure games interesting for artificial intelligence research since to succeed at a such games an AI agent needs to understand language, perform common-sense reasoning, and interact with objects in a constrained world.
