<p>In this home, you will play a couple text-adventure games, and answer some questions about them. This is <strong>not</strong> a partner homework; you should complete it on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Play the text adventure game <a href="http://iplayif.com/?story=http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/Bronze.zblorb">Bronze</a>, either until you win it or you have spent over an hour on it.  Draw a map of the game as you go.</li>
  <li>Play <a href="https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/nickwalton/AIDungeon/blob/master/AIDungeon_2.ipynb">AI Dungeon 2</a>, a machine-generated text adventure.</li>
  <li>Answer the quetions in the following section.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Were you able to beat Bronze?</li>
  <li>What do you perceive are the challenges in designing a text adventure game as compared to non-interactive fiction?</li>
  <li>While AI Dungeon 2 is fun to play, it clearly gets a lot of things wrong. What is the system lacking as compared to hand-crafted games?</li>
  <li>If you had near-infinite resources (for GPUs, to build datasets, to collect human annotations, etc.), how would you propose to improve AI Dungeon to make it more fun to play?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to submit</h2>

<p>Submit a PDF to Gradescope containing the answers to the questions.</p>
