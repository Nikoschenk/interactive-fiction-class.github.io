<h2 id="state-tracking-in-the-world">State tracking in the world</h2>

<p>One place where older Infocom-style text adventure games do better than modern games like  AI Dungeon 2 is in their ability to keep track of the state of the world.  What objects are in the player’s inventory?  What room are we in?  Where can we go from here? What tools are required to unlock a door?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are God.  It’s your job to create the heavens and the earth. Everything is formless and empty.  It is dark now.</p>

  <p>&gt;“Let there be light.”</p>

  <p>There is now light.  A new day starts.  It’s morning.  The new sun shines down on an empty planet.</p>

  <p>&gt;“Make an ocean.”</p>

  <p>You create an ocean.  The Earth’s surface is now covered in water.  The sun shines off the water’s surface.</p>

  <p>&gt;“Create some continents.”</p>

  <p>Several contients raise out of the ocean’s depths.  There are now continuous expanses of land.  They have nothing on them.</p>

  <p>&gt;“Cover the continents in plants.”</p>

  <p>The land is now covered in vegetation.  There are seed-bearing plants and trees that bear fruit.</p>

  <p>&gt;Eat some fruit.</p>

  <p>You pluck an apple from a tree and consume it.  It tastes divine. There is a seed in your mouth.</p>

  <p>&gt;Swallow seed.</p>
