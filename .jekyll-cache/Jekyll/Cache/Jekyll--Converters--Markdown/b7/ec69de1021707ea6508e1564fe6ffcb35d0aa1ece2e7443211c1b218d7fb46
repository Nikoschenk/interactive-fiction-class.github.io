  <dd>CIS 700-008 - Interactive Fiction and Text Generation</dd>
  <dt>Course Description</dt>
  <dd>In this course, we will study how natural language processing is used to develop interactive and creative text applications. We will first cover text adventure games, which are interesting for artificial intelligence research since to succeed at a such games an AI agent needs to understand language, perform common-sense reasoning, and interact with objects in a constrained world.   We cover approaches to interpreting user input via a natural language understanding component called the ‚Äúparser‚Äù.  We will discuss various strategies for representing a world and modeling how it changes based on user interaction. Next, we will also cover topics like common-sense reasoning tasks, and extracting of narrative structure from stories. Finally, we will discuss natural language generation, both in the context of dialog agents and story generation.  We will touch upon human-computer interaction, biases in language models, and other topics.</dd>

: This class will cover severl areas.
* Text Adventure Games - How they are implemented and how we can build agents that automatically solve them.
* Common-sense Reasoning - TODO
* Narrative Understanding - Extracting narrative structure (event schemas) from text
* Text Generation - Generating natural-sounding text that follows a desired style, narrative arc, or other attribute.
* Chatbots / Dialog Systems - TODO

  <dt>Grading</dt>
  <dd>TBD. Below is a sample grading rubric, which will change.</dd>
  <dd>There will be three homeworks and a final project. In addition, you will be required to present a paper from the required reading in class.
    <ul>
      <li>10% Paper presentation</li>
      <li>45% Homeworks</li>
      <li>45% Final project</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Collaboration Policy</dt>
  <dd>Unless otherwise noted, you ARE allowed to work in pairs on the homework assignments, and teams of 2-4 for the final project.</dd>
  <dt>Late Day Policy</dt>
  <dd>Each student has five free ‚Äúlate days‚Äù.  Homeworks can be submitted at most two days late.  If you are out of late days, then you will not be able to get credit for subsequent late assignments. One ‚Äúday‚Äù is defined as anytime between 1 second and 24 hours after the homework deadline. The intent of the late day policy it to allow you to take extra time due to unforseen circumstances like illnesses or family emergencies, and for forseeable interruptions like on campus interviewing and religious holidays.  You do not need to ask permission to use your late days.  No additional late days are granted.</dd>
